This project demonstrates how to combine Active Directory, Sysmon, and Splunk to monitor and detect security events in a Windows domain environment. 

By configuring Universal Forwarders, building dashboards, and creating alerts, the lab shows practical SOC skills such as log ingestion, event correlation, and incident detection for AD-related threats.
