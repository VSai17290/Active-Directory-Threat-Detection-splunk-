# VM Setup

## Virtual Machines on Host A

The following VMs are created on the host system:
- **Ubuntu Server** – for Splunk Enterprise.
- **Windows Server** – for Active Directory Domain Services.
- **Kali Linux** – for penetration testing and simulated attacks. 

On other hosts (or the same host with more VMs), Windows 10 virtual machines act as domain-joined endpoints with logging enabled. 

## Base Configuration

- Allocate sufficient RAM/CPU for each VM (e.g., 2–4 GB RAM for Windows, 2 GB RAM for Ubuntu/Kali).
- Install VirtualBox Guest Additions where needed for better performance and folder sharing.
