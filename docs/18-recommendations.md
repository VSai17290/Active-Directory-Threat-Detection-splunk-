# Recommendations

- Extend the lab by adding more detection use cases (e.g., Pass-the-Hash, privilege escalation, lateral movement). 
- Integrate additional tools such as a ticketing system or SOAR platform to practice end-to-end incident response. 
- Harden GPOs further with stricter policies for password complexity, application control, and logging. 
- Use threat simulation frameworks (like Atomic Red Team) to regularly test SIEM detections.
